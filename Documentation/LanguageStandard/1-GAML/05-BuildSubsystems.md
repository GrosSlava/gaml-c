# Build subsystems

**GAML** provides program build for various types of subsystems.



## Subsystems

1. Console - common and simplest type of build (can be supported by most of systems) \
can be upgraded to `Window` subsystem by additional libraries

2. Window - type of build for programs with UI, provides empty window by default \
can be easily integrated with the system window manager



## DLL

**DLL** - dynamic link library (it can be called differently on different systems)

**GAML** provides dll build.
