# Recommended code style

1. It is preferable to use CamelCase instead of snake_case in any names(because it can create conflict in C-code names)
2. It is preferable to give prefix to your types:
	- **F** - for structs
	- **U** - for objects and componets
	- **I** - for interfaces
	- **E** - for enums
3. It is preferable to use tabs in nested blocks
