# Build-in templates

Built-in templates are types that implement additional functionality for working with them with any other type. \
These types will not be available if the platform does not support them or if their use is disabled in the compiler settings.



[`array`](09-Array.md)`<|T|>` - built-in template array for any type \
[`class`](10-Class.md)`<|T|>` - built-in template container of any class type
