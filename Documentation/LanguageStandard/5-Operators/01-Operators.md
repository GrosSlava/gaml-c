# Operators

## Kinds of operators

1. `Control` operators
2. `Expression` operators



## Control operators

Control operators are operators that provide a change in the behavior of the program.

### Complex control operators

1. Operator [do](02-OperatorDo.md)
2. Operator [for](03-OperatorFor.md)
3. Operator [foreach](04-OperatorForeach.md)
4. Operator [if/else](05-OperatorIfElse.md)
5. Operator [switch/case](06-OperatorSwitchCase.md)
6. Operator [while](07-OperatorWhile.md)

### Simple control operators

1. [Assert](08-Asserts.md) operators
2. [Declaration](09-DeclarationOperators.md) operators
3. [Statement](10-StatementControlOperators.md) control operators



## Expression operators

Expression operators are operators that can be used for describing action or can be used as part of control operator.

1. [List](11-ExpressionOperators.md) of expression operators
2. [Precedence](12-OperatorsPrecedence.md) of expression operators
